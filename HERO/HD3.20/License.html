<h1>GoPro Firmware License</h1>


<p>GoPro, Inc. (&ldquo;GoPro&rdquo;) grants you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the software that is embedded in the GoPro product that you purchased from GoPro (the &ldquo;Firmware&rdquo;), solely in binary form, as embedded in the single GoPro product. The Firmware is licensed, not sold, to You by GoPro for use only under the terms of this License. You own the GoPro product that you purchased on which the Firmware is recorded, but GoPro and its licensors retain ownership of the Firmware and reserve all rights not expressly granted to You. You may not copy the Firmware except as permitted in these terms. You agree not to disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, decrypt, modify or create derivative works of any portions of the Firmware, or permit any third party to do so, except, and solely to the extent, if any, that applicable local law requires that such activities be permitted. You may not remove, alter or obscure any product identification, copyright or other proprietary rights notices embedded within or on the Firmware. You may not distribute, transfer, sublicense, sell, rent, lease, loan or otherwise make the Firmware available to any third party except as expressly permitted herein. You may, however, make a one-time, permanent transfer of all of your license rights in the Firmware to another party in connection with the transfer of ownership of your GoPro product, provided that the transfer includes your GoPro product and all Firmware, including all component parts, printed materials and this license, and the party receiving the GoPro product reads and agrees to accept these terms and conditions. GoPro, at its discretion, may make available updates to the Firmware.  Unless that update is accompanied by a separate license, this License will govern use of the update.  Firmware updates may be compatible only with certain GoPro product models, and you agree to use the firmware update only with compatible GoPro product models. If a firmware update replaces a previously licensed version of the Firmware, you may not use both versions of the Firmware at the same time or transfer them separately. THE FIRMWARE IS PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS,&rdquo; WITH ALL FAULTS. GOPRO MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION THAT THE OPERATION (OR DOWNLOAD) OF FIRMWARE (INCLUDING ANY UPDATES) WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT ANY DEFECTS IN ANY FIRMWARE WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE FIRMWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR WORK IN COMBINATION WITH ANY HARDWARE OR APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES. GOPRO DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY GOPRO OR ANY OF LICENSOR&rsquo;S EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES WILL CREATE A WARRANTY.</p>
